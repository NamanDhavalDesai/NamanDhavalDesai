1) Prism:

Players research and information searching model.

Improvised on a previously existing static database which stores the information of all the different versions of football players in an online game (FIFA Mobile). This already existing static database does not show the user all the parameters at once, hence to compare between the statistics of players is almost impossible. Implement the storage of different accounts of different users making the database comparatively more secure and personalized too. Implement a better way of visualizing and comparing the differences between different versions of players. Include and view personalized and detailed information of each player in the database. 
Languages to be used: JAVA and SQL. 

The contents of this repsitory are as follows:
1) Folder NRX07, this folder conatains the entire java code which includes the GUI (pictures included) within the src sub folder. It is in a java application blueprint.
2) Folder SQL contains the SQL code (needed to be run before the java program) and the data extracted from the internet in .csv format in the Data folder. You can copy and paste this data in the structure created by the sql code if you do not want to extract data from the internet (sraping takes 3+ hours).
3) Folder Documents contains the working paper, EER diagram, flowchart diagram and a powerpoint presentation on the working of the application.
4) Folder Test contains the java code used to test the mysql connector and the working of the jsoup package.
