This contains 8 repositories.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Prism:

Players research and information searching model.

Improvised on a previously existing static database which stores the information of all the different versions of football players in an online game (FIFA Mobile). This already existing static database does not show the user all the parameters at once, hence to compare between the statistics of players is almost impossible. Implement the storage of different accounts of different users making the database comparatively more secure and personalized too. Implement a better way of visualizing and comparing the differences between different versions of players. Include and view personalized and detailed information of each player in the database. 
Languages to be used: JAVA and SQL. 

The contents of this repsitory are as follows:
1) Folder NRX07, this folder conatains the entire java code which includes the GUI (pictures included) within the src sub folder. It is in a java application blueprint.
2) Folder SQL contains the SQL code (needed to be run before the java program) and the data extracted from the internet in .csv format in the Data folder. You can copy and paste this data in the structure created by the sql code if you do not want to extract data from the internet (sraping takes 3+ hours).
3) Folder Documents contains the working paper, EER diagram, flowchart diagram and a powerpoint presentation on the working of the application.
4) Folder Test contains the java code used to test the mysql connector and the working of the jsoup package.

10) Chest-X-Ray-Classifier
  
The following program uses a CNN model to classify if a chest x-ray image is healthy or not. This function will be able to differentiate multiclass categories where label names are present: normal, virus, and bacteria. To solve this problem CNN modelling (Convolutional Neural Network) is used, due to its excellent image-splitting ability.

Dataset used:
- The dataset used in this project could be found and installed from the Kaggle link mentioned below, https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia. 
- The entirety of the dataset is approximately 1.3 GB consisting of three sub folders. The constituents and description of these sub folder is mentioned below:  
    This is the main folder which contains 3 main sub folders named test, train and val (validation).  
  - The training dataset is generally the largest dataset as the model needs to be created from the data it provides.  
  - The testing dataset is generally smaller to the training dataset but larger than the validation dataset as this generally provides the accuracy of the model            by testing the model.  
  - The validation dataset generally is the smallest dataset and provides the validation to the model.  

- The training dataset comprises Normal or healthy lungs (1341 images) with the existence of a total of 766 peopleâ€™s x-rays and Pneumonia or people having unhealthy lungs (3875 images), among which 1345 and 2530 samples for virus and bacteria respectively. There exists singular or multiple x-rays images of individual people. In the second case, there are in total 1945 peopleâ€™s x-rays. Whereas, the test dataset comprises two output classes such as healthy lungs (234 images) and people having unhealthy lungs (390 images).

- The data is read by the program and then depending on the imagesâ€™ characteristics the model is made which can now classify if a pair of lungs are healthy or unhealthy and if they are unhealthy then does the person have virus or a bacterial infection. The contents of the validation dataset are used to validate the classifier after it has been made. It could be considered as a part of the training dataset. It usually is not a large dataset. Usually out of a hundred percent 70 percent of the data belongs to the training dataset while the remaining 30 percent usually belongs to the validation set. This sub folder contains two more sub-sub folders such as Normal (8 images) and Pneumonia (8 images). All the images in this sub-sub folder are x-rays of people having healthy and unhealthy lungs (bacteria or virus). It prevents overfitting of the classifier and helps to tune the parameters of the model.

Results:  
- Accuracy, Misclassification rate, Precision, Sensitivity (Recall), Specificity and F1-score can be calculated using the formulae mentioned bellow:
  - Accuracy: (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN): 
  - Misclassification rate: (FP + FN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN) or (1 - Accuracy): 
  - Precision: (TP) / (TP + FP):
  - Sensitivity: (TP) / (TP + FN):
  - Specificity: (TN) / (TN + FP):
  - F1-score: (2 x Precision x Sensitivity) / (Precision + Sensitivity) or (2 x TP) / ((2 x TP) + FP + FN):

|Variable:|TP:|TN:|FP:|FN:|Accuracy:|Misclassification rate:|Precision|Sensitivity:|Specificity:|F1-score:|
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
|Bacteria:|230|333|12|49|90.22%|9.78%|95.04%|82.44%|96.52%|88.29%|
|Normal:|170|379|64|11|87.98%|12.02%|72.65%|93.92%|85.55%|81.93%|
